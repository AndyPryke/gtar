# Proprietary R Packages Talk

This directory contains the source files and rendered HTML presentation for the
talk I gave on 2019-06-04 at the GTA R User Group. To render it correctly you
may need to install some fonts.

You can inspect the source `.Rmd` file and the `Makefile` used to build it, if
you so desire.
